        <p>I love pizza.

            Pizza is my Roman Empire.

            In the words of comedian Mike Birbiglia, I love pizza so much I get excited when I see the word ‚Äúplaza‚Äù.

            I grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, which is famously known for its pizza, or ‚Äòapizza‚Äô. Apizza is a style of pizza with a thin-crust, coal-charred crust and delicious ‚Äúmootz‚Äù ü§å forged in the fires of the Neapolitan technique. We have three pizzerias that we fondly call the Holy Trinity - Frank Pepe‚Äôs, Sally‚Äôs Apizza, and Modern Apizza. We are also quite creative with white clam pizza, mashed potato pizza, the Brussel Hustle... the list could go on. 
            I created TopZa as both a celebration of pizza - a place to take meticulous notes and highly debatable ratings - as well as a way to test and push my programming skills. I hope you enjoy it! 
            Happy pizza eating! üçï</p>
