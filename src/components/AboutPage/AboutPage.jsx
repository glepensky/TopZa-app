          I love pizza.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Pizza is my Roman Empire.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the words of comedian Mike Birbiglia, I love pizza so much I get
          excited when I see the word ‚Äúplaza‚Äù.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, which is famously known
          for its pizza, or ‚Äòapizza‚Äô. Apizza is a style of pizza with a
          thin-crust, coal-charred crust and delicious ‚Äúmootz‚Äù ü§å forged in the
          fires of the Neapolitan technique. We have three pizzerias that we
          fondly call the Holy Trinity - Frank Pepe‚Äôs, Sally‚Äôs Apizza, and
          Modern Apizza. We are also quite creative with white clam pizza,
          mashed potato pizza, the Brussel Hustle... the list could go on. I
          created TopZa as both a celebration of pizza - a place to take
          meticulous notes and highly debatable ratings - as well as a way to
          test and push my programming skills. I hope you enjoy it!
