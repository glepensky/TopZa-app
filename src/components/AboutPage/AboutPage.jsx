          More to come‚Ä¶
          <br></br>
          <br></br>Looking ahead, we're crafting a suite of savory features to
          enhance your pizza journey. Our future updates aim to include a rating
          system, allowing you to score each pizzeria based on categories like
          cheese, crust and presentation. 
          <br></br>In addition, so we'll be introducing a
          personalized note-taking feature for you to jot down those flavor
          nuances and memorable moments. 
          <br></br>We also know that anticipation is part
          of the fun, which is why we plan to roll out a "Wishlist" function to
          keep track of all the pizza places you're yearning to visit. 
          <br></br>Finally,
          get ready for the "Pizza Hall of Fame," a dedicated spot to celebrate
          the cr√®me de la cr√®me of pizzas as voted by you.Stay tuned for these
          updates and more as we continue to build the ultimate pizza-lover's
          companion app!

            I love pizza.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Pizza is my Roman Empire.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In the words of comedian Mike Birbiglia, I love pizza so much I get
            excited when I see the word ‚Äúplaza‚Äù.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, which is famously
            known for its pizza, or ‚Äòapizza‚Äô. Apizza is a style of pizza with a
            thin-crust, coal-charred crust and delicious ‚Äúmootz‚Äù ü§å forged in
            the fires of the Neapolitan technique. We have three pizzerias that
            we fondly call the Holy Trinity - Frank Pepe‚Äôs, Sally‚Äôs Apizza, and
            Modern Apizza. We are also quite creative with white clam pizza,
            mashed potato pizza, the Brussel Hustle... the list could go on. I
            created TopZa as both a celebration of pizza - a place to take
            meticulous notes and highly debatable ratings - as well as a way to
            test and push my programming skills. I hope you enjoy it!
            <br></br>
